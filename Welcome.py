    We offer a variety of algorithmic implementations to ensure a fair distribution of these items, taking into account the concept of weighted envy-freeness (WEF).
    
    Weighted envy-freeness is a fairness criterion that aims to minimize the envy experienced by participants in an allocation process. It assigns a weight to each participant's preferences, allowing for personalized fairness. Our app will help you find an allocation that balances these preferences as closely as possible, maximizing overall satisfaction.

    1. Start by providing the number of participants and the available items.
    2. For each participant, specify their preferences for the items. You can assign weights to these preferences to reflect their importance.
    3. Once you've entered all the preferences, click on the 'Run Allocation Algorithm' button.
    4. Our algorithms will process the inputs and generate an allocation that minimizes envy while considering the weights assigned to preferences.
    5. The app will display the resulting allocation along with any relevant statistics or insights.
